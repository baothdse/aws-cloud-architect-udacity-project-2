Rationale for Changes: 
To add redundancy and improve performance, we will upgrage our aws architecture as below:
Change S3 standart to s3 intelligent tiering to improve the performance with the most effective cost
Upgrade db instance from m4 to db.m1.large and change export snapshot from per week to per day for data recovery.
Change instance type of EC2 instances and auto scaling instances to m5 to improve performance
Add a network load balancer to avoid bottom neck
